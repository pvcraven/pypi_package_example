Continuous Integration
======================

There are many services that will automatically build your project on multiple
platforms and run unit tests, code formatting tests, and code coverage tests.

While you can create your own in-house build machine, there are companies that
already have it set up. Some of them include:

* Appveyor_
* Jenkins_
* TravisCI_

* ``.coveralls.yml``
* ``.travis.yml`` Here is the `TravisCI for pypi_package_example`_
